This system is designed to automate the process of watering plants efficiently. It consists of STM32 microcontrollers as sensor nodes and an ESP32 as the gateway. The STM32 nodes are responsible for collecting data from soil moisture sensors and controlling water flow through actuators (such as valves or pumps). Each node is deployed in different zones of the garden or farm, where they measure soil conditions and determine whether irrigation is needed.

The ESP32 gateway connects to a Node.js server that uses MongoDB for data storage. The gateway communicates with the server using the MQTT protocol, allowing for efficient message passing and data exchange between the gateway and the server. The collected data from the STM32 nodes is sent to the server, where it is stored in the MongoDB database.

To enable real-time data updates, the server utilizes WebSocket technology to transmit information between the server and the frontend application. Users can monitor the current status of soil moisture levels and irrigation activities through a web dashboard, with real-time updates reflecting any changes made in the system. They can also adjust system settings or manually activate irrigation from the frontend interface.
