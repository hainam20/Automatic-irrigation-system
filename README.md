Overview
The Automatic Irrigation System is designed to efficiently automate the process of watering plants using advanced technology. The system comprises STM32 microcontrollers functioning as sensor nodes and an ESP32 serving as the gateway. This setup allows for real-time monitoring and control of irrigation based on soil moisture levels.

Features
STM32 Nodes: Low-power microcontrollers that collect data from soil moisture sensors and control water flow through actuators (valves or pumps).
ESP32 Gateway: Acts as a bridge between the STM32 nodes and the Node.js server.
Node.js Server: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage and handles incoming data from the ESP32 gateway.
MQTT Protocol: Efficient message passing and data exchange between the ESP32 gateway and the server.
WebSocket Technology: Enables real-time data updates between the server and frontend application, allowing users to monitor and control the system.
Remote Monitoring: Users can view soil moisture levels and irrigation activities through a web dashboard or mobile app.

Components
STM32 Microcontroller: Used as the sensor node to monitor soil conditions.
ESP32: Serves as the gateway for communication between nodes and the server.
Node.js: Backend server that processes data and manages communication.
MongoDB: Database used to store sensor data.
MQTT: Protocol for lightweight messaging between the gateway and server.
WebSocket: Technology for real-time communication between the server and frontend.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automatic-irrigation-system.git
cd automatic-irrigation-system
Set up the Node.js server:

Navigate to the server directory.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the server:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Set up MongoDB:

Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
Create a database for storing sensor data.
Configure ESP32:

Upload the ESP32 firmware code to your board.
Ensure it connects to the correct MQTT broker and server endpoint.
Deploy STM32 Nodes:

Upload the firmware to each STM32 node.
Deploy the nodes in different zones of your garden or farm.
Usage
Access the web dashboard at http://localhost:3000 (or your server's address) to monitor soil moisture levels and control irrigation.
Real-time updates will reflect any changes made in the system.
